# Material Hub Android Canary

Material Hub is an all-in-one Android app designed to help you organize your day with integrated news, weather, and to-do list features—all wrapped in a modern Material Design 3 interface.

> **Update**: The app has functions and sort of works, but it currently crashes as soon as you open it. I am working on a fix!
